	  KASAN has two modes: generic KASAN (similar to userspace ASan,
	  x86_64/arm64/xtensa, enabled with CONFIG_KASAN_GENERIC) and
	  software tag-based KASAN (a version based on software memory
	  tagging, arm64 only, similar to userspace HWASan, enabled with
	  CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS).
	  Both generic and tag-based KASAN are strictly debugging features.

	  Enables kernel address sanitizer - runtime memory debugger,

	  This is strictly a debugging feature and it requires a gcc version
	  of 4.9.2 or later. Detection of out of bounds accesses to stack or
	  global variables requires gcc 5.0 or later.
	  This feature consumes about 1/8 of available memory and brings about

=======
	  Enables generic KASAN mode.
	  Supported in both GCC and Clang. With GCC it requires version 4.9.2
	  or later for basic support and version 5.0 or later for detection of
	  out-of-bounds accesses for stack and global variables and for inline
	  instrumentation mode (CONFIG_KASAN_INLINE). With Clang it requires
	  version 3.7.0 or later and it doesn't support detection of
	  out-of-bounds accesses for global variables yet.
	  This mode consumes about 1/8th of available memory at kernel start
	  and introduces an overhead of ~x1.5 for the rest of the allocations.
	  The performance slowdown is ~x3.
	  For better error detection enable CONFIG_STACKTRACE.
	  Currently CONFIG_KASAN_GENERIC doesn't work with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB

	help
	  Enables software tag-based KASAN mode.
	  This mode requires Top Byte Ignore support by the CPU and therefore
	  is only supported for arm64.
	  This mode requires Clang version 7.0.0 or later.
	  This mode consumes about 1/16th of available memory at kernel start
	  and introduces an overhead of ~20% for the rest of the allocations.
	  This mode may potentially introduce problems relating to pointer
	  casting and comparison, as it embeds tags into the top byte of each
	  pointer.
	  For better error detection enable CONFIG_STACKTRACE.
	  Currently CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS doesn't work with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB
	  (the resulting kernel does not boot).

	help
	  Before every memory access compiler insert function call

	  much as inline does.

config KASAN_INLINE

	help
	  Compiler directly inserts code checking shadow memory before
	  memory accesses. This is faster than outline (in some workloads
	  it gives about x2 boost over outline instrumentation), but

	  The LLVM stack address sanitizer has a know problem that

	  Disabling asan-stack makes it safe to run kernels build
	  with clang-8 with KASAN enabled, though it loses some of
	  the functionality.
	  This feature is always disabled when compile-testing with clang-8
	  or earlier to avoid cluttering the output in stack overflow
	  warnings, but clang-8 users can still enable it for builds without
	  CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST.  On gcc and later clang versions it is
	  assumed to always be safe to use and enabled by default.
